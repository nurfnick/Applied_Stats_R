## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
df <- read.csv("player_data.csv")
df <- df %>% mutate( h = as.numeric(map_chr(str_extract_all(Ht,"\\d"), paste, collapse = "")),
        multiplyer = ifelse(str_detect(Ht, "Jun"),6,
                            ifelse(str_detect(Ht, "May"),5,7)),
        Ht = h + 12*multiplyer)%>%
  select(-c(multiplyer,h))
  

head(df)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
