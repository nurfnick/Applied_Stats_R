```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data = read.csv('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqgF8LceNHHR7Fy9PbTN3pFVnjQwvEyGeQnkCFO43GMaNSZ1qzdTcLwh-uZdUp01zsDAd679r3YowF/pub?output=csv')

```

## San Francisco Crime

I discovered this data set at <https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/sanfranciso-crime-dataset>.  In order to create my data file, I clicked the icon to upload to Google sheets, published it to the web and copied a link.  Some data will be possible to upload to github but if the file is large github will not do it.  You need the data to be in a raw form, with csv.


```{r}
summary(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
