# Regression Homework Helper

I am again going to try to keep it simple by using base R but doing some of the homework questions.

1. Use a scatterplot and the linear correlation coefficient r to determine whether there is a correlation between the two variables. (Note: Use software, and don't forget to look at the scatterplot!) 

First I'll load the data.  I could load the data via a csv but to keep the reprodicibility high, I am going to manually enter the data.
```{r}
x <-c(0.8,1.4 ,2,3.5,4.5,5.4,6.1,7.8,8.4,9.7,10.3,11.7,12.8,13.2,14.8)
y <- c(14.2,13.6,13,11.5,10.5,9.6,8.9,7.2,6.6,5.3,4.7,3.3,2.2,1.8,0.2)

plot(x,y)
```

That looks rather nicely linear!  Of course it is negatively correlated (the slope is negative!).

To get the correlation $r$

```{r}

cor(x,y,method = "pearson")
```
We are using the 'Pearson' correlation method here.  If I call the **cor** fucntion without that it will give me several answers.

Let's repeat this using the definition of correlation!
$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline x)(y_i-\overline y )}{(n-1)s_xs_y}
$$
```{r}
sx = sd(x)
sy = sd(y) 
n = length(x)
xbar = mean(x)
ybar = mean(y)


numerator = mean((x-xbar)*(y-ybar))*n

r = numerator/((n-1)*sx*sy)
r
```
Sweet!  There are a couple of interesting things I did above!  I took a sequence $x$ and subtracted a single value $\overline x$ from each value.  I also multiplied sequences.

Let's also get the equation of the linear relationship.

```{r}
lm(y~x)

```
This brings in a couple of interesting R calls.  I needed to do a function so I did **y~x** you see that I am making a function!  Let's define a function too so I can make some predictions.
```{r}
fit = lm(y~x)

slope = coef(fit)[2]
intercept = coef(fit)[1]

yhat <- function(xpredict){
  return( slope*xpredict+intercept)
}

yhat(10)
```
So here I did it with a user defined function.  While I was doing this I noticed the following command I could have used!

```{r}
xToPredict <-data.frame(x = c(10))
predict(fit, newdata = xToPredict)
```
We may want commands like this later!  This command was a little bit of a pain becuase you can only pass a dataframe to the newdata option.  One really nice feature though is that I can do confidence intervals!
```{r}
predict(fit, newdata = xToPredict, interval = 'confidence')
```
Well crumb!  This one is not interesting because it is a perfect fit, $r=1$.  In any case it is giving us the 95% CI.

Lastly we shoud perfom a hypothesis test.  Here the null hypothesis is that there is no correlation.
$$
H_0: \rho =0\\
H_A: \rho\neq 0
$$
We have already computed our estimate of the test statistic $r$.  Then $t$ is
$$
t =
\frac{r\sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}
$$
Here the degrees of freedom will be $df=n-2$

```{r}
t = r*sqrt(n-2)/sqrt(1-r^2)
t
```
There is no chance this happens!  Really I am dividing by 0...

```{r}
pt(t,n-2)
```

So yes, we can reject the null hypothesis, the $p$ is low.

If instead we want to test the slope of the line.  We consider the following as the theorectical fit
$$  
\hat y = \beta_0+\beta_1x
$$

The standard error for the slope is
$$  
SE_{\beta_1} = \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{\sum\left(x_i-\overline x\right)^2}} 
$$

Where 
$$
MSE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i-\hat y_i\right)^2}{n-2}
$$

$MSE$ is referred to as the mean square error.  It adds all the square errors and divides by the adjusted total $(n-2)$ because of the degrees of freedom!

```{r}
yframe = data.frame('Values' = y)
yhat <- predict(fit,yframe)
MSE = sum((y-yhat)^2)/(n-2)
MSE
```

The denominator in the $SE$ computation above is sometimes called the $S_{xx}$ The sum of the squares of $x$.
```{r}
sxx = sum((x-xbar)^2)
```

Then we can now compute the standard error for the slope as
```{r}
SEslope = sqrt(MSE/sxx)
SEslope
```

If instead I wanted to look at the intercept, $\beta_0$, it's standard error is
$$
SE_{\beta_0} = \sqrt{MSE\left(\frac1n+\frac{\overline x}{S_{xx}}\right)}
$$

This will be straight forward as I have already computed all these values.
```{r}
SEintercept = sqrt(MSE*(1/n+xbar^2/sxx))
SEintercept
```

Both $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are $t$-student distributed with degrees of freedom $df = n-2$.

If I want to do the confidence interval for a prediction by hand, it is very similar!  For an $x_h$ that you want to predict,
$$
SE_{x_h}=\sqrt{MSE\left(\frac1n+\frac{\left(x_h-\overline x\right)^2}{S_{xx}}\right)}
$$
Again this is $t$-studnet distributed.  I won't do this computation since I had R do it, but I could!

My example is clunky here because I had a perfect fit to begin with but you can see that these computations are not terrible with R!  Also we are going to see shortly that R will return all of these values if I ask it to...

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

I was thinking about this problem a few hours later and low and behold there is a way to get R to tell you all of these values...  Passing the **fit** to the **summary()** function, we see all these outputs computed for you.  Standard Errors and even the MSE are computed right here!

Okay I cannot resist graphing...
```{r}
plot(x,y)
abline(fit)
```
```{r}
plot(fit)
```
I don't really know what many of these plots are.  Normall Q-Q is looking at the normality of the points in the input.  The rest I have no idea about.  Maybe a project if someone is interested...

2.  In some cases, the best-fitting multiple regression equation is of the form $\hat y=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3$. The graph of such an equation is called a cubic. Using the data set given below, and letting $x_1=x$, $x_2=x^2$, and $x_3=x^3$, find the multiple regression equation for the cubic that best fits the given data.


```{r}
xnew <- c(-8,-7,-2,0,3,6,10)
ynew <- c(3.9,0.9,1.6,4.4,4.4,-5.2,-45.3)
xsquare = xnew^2
xcube = xnew^3
quadraticfit = lm(ynew~xnew+xsquare+xcube)
summary(quadraticfit)
```

I'll conclude with a graphic!
```{r}
eqn = function(x){
  coef(quadraticfit)[1]
  +
    coef(quadraticfit)[2]*x
  +
    coef(quadraticfit)[3]*x^2
  +
    coef(quadraticfit)[4]*x^3}


plot(x=1, xlim = c(-9,11),ylim = c(-46,15), xlab = "Great",ylab = "Scott")
points(xnew,ynew)
curve(eqn, add = TRUE)

```

This was harder than I thought it would be, I do prefer the ggplot2 package!
